## Xen Lockscreen
Re-imagine your lockscreen
=========

_Please note that this code was written between 2015 and 2017_

This tweak allows the user to have pages of content directly on the lockscreen, along with providing improvements to notifications, media artwork and more.

Supports iOS 9 and 10, and all device types. Note that whilst iOS 9 compatibility is complete, iOS 10 support should be considered as beta.

### Tweak Details

These pages can be arranged in any order, and can be added or removed from the lockscreen with ease.

**Notifications**

Xen Lockscreen allows grouping of notifications together per app, along with applying a custom styling similar to iOS 10 for iOS 9 users.
